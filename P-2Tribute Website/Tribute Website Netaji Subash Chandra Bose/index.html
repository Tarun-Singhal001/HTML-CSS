                <p><b>Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose (1897 - 1945)</b> was an Indian revolutionary and nationalist leader
                    who played a key
                    role in the country's independence movement. He is also known as "Netaji".</p>
                <p>Bose was born in Cuttack, Orissa (now Odisha) to Janakinath Bose and Prabhavati Devi. He graduated
                    from
                    the University of Calcutta's Scottish Church College in 1918 with a degree in Philosophy.</p>
                <p>Bose was a leader of the Indian National Congress and helped organize the Non-Cooperation Movement in
                    1920. He is known for his leadership skills and oratory abilities, and his famous slogans include
                    "Jai
                    Hind", "Delhi Chalo", and "Tum mujhe khoon do, main tumhe aazadi dunga".</p>
                <p>During World War II, Bose led an Indian national force from abroad against the Western powers. He
                    also
                    formed Azad Hind Fauj and made other contributions to India's freedom struggle. However, his wartime
                    alliances with Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan have left a legacy that is complicated by
                    authoritarianism.</p>
